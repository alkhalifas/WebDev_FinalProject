## Our Product

This website is an application developed for the purpose of helping developers of 
various computer languages save, find and recycle their code with ease. The 
platform includes a number of features that allow users to find, read, and edit code 
which are saved in the form of snippets. Users can create and edit their own 
snippets, search snippets by tag/topic, like snippets, view other users snippets, and 
view admin-recommended snippets. They can also import snippets from, and export
snippets to GitHub Gists.
